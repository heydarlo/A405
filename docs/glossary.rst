     *Notes*: `Buoyancy and stability'

     *Definition*: The Buoyancy force is the force that is exerted by either a liquid, gas or 
      other fluid, that opposes an object's weight. A property of an 
      object that enables it to float on the surface of a liquid, or enables
      it to ascend through or remain freely suspended in a compressible
      fluid similar to what we find in the atmosphere.   



     Chemical potential

     "useful" work obtainable from a closed thernodynamic system
     at a constant tempreature and volume.

   helmholtz free energy

     *Definition*:  :math:`f \equiv u - Ts` where u is the internal energy, T is
     the temperature and s is the entropy (see above definition). When 
     considering energy conservation of one or more systems at a constant 
     temperature it is more useful to look at the Free Energy rather than the
     Internal Energy.

     *Notes*: `internal energy notes`_ -- 
     *Text*: p. 72

     *Definition*: Kinetic and potential energy of a system's molecules and
     atoms (doesn't count the kinetic energy of the system moving
     as a unit, or the potential energy due to movement in an
     external gravitational or electromagnetic field)

     *units*: :math:`J kg^{-1}`  -- 
     *Notes*: `moist static energy notes`_
     *Text*: p. 86

   quadratic degree of freedom
     *Definition*: A degree of freedom is quadratic if the energy terms 
     associated to this degree of freedom can be written as:
     E = :math:`aX^2 + bXY`
     Where the square on the X term indicates the quadratic degrees of 
     freedom. This means that they system has two degrees of freedom.

   potential energy
     *symbol*: :math:`U` --
     *units*: :math:`J` --
     *Notes*: `internal energy notes`_ (mentioned) --

     position based on their frame of reference.

     *units*: :math:`Pa`  -- 
     *Text*: Ch. 8 

     *Definition*: If an object at equilibrium has a compressibility less
     than that of the surrounding fluid, the object's equilibrium is stable
     and it remains at rest. If, however, its compressibility is greater,
     its equilibrium is then unstable, and it rises and expands on the slightest
     upward perturbation, or falls and compresses on the slightest downward
     perturbation.
